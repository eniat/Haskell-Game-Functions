-- [Questions] ----------------------------------------------------------------
-- You should implement the functions as specified below.
-- Skeletons of each function have been provided with the correct types, and
-- an implementation that uses `error` to immediately crash.  You should delete 
-- the `error` call and correctly implement the function.
-- You may define additional functions or types as you desire to help you
-- complete each question.
-- DO NOT CHANGE THE TYPES OF THE FUNCTIONS.



-- Q 1) Write the two functions below to return the width and height of a game map.
-- 2 marks.

getHeight :: GameMap -> Int
getHeight (GameMap []) = 0
getHeight (GameMap g) = length g


getWidth :: GameMap -> Int
getWidth (GameMap []) = 0

isInBounds g (x, y) = (getWidth g) > x && (getHeight g) > y && x >= 0 && y >= 0


-- Q 3) Write the function below to take a coordinate and generate a new one 1 step in the
-- given direction.  This function should ignore the bounds of the map and calculate the
-- coordinate regardless.
-- 1 mark. 

offsetCoord :: Coord -> Dir -> Coord

        North -> (x, y - 1)
        South -> (x, y + 1)

    | isInBounds (GameMap g) (x, y) = Just ((g !! y) !! x)
    | otherwise = Nothing 


-- Q 5) Write the function below to return True if the terrain at the given location is
-- passable.  Passable terrain are floors and open doors.  Nothing out of bounds is passable.

-- Q 6) Write the function below which takes a gamemap, coordinate, and a direction, and
-- returns a new coordinate which is the result of that move with an Either type.
-- If the move was possible then the result should be (Right) with the new coord.
-- If the move was not possible then the result should be (Left) with the current coord.

-- default values of 100 health, no items, and a position of (1,1).
-- 1 mark.

newPlayer :: String -> Player
newPlayer n = Player n (1,1) 100 []


-- Q 8) Write the function below to create a "status line" string describing the current
-- state of the player.
-- The line should be formatted as follows, with commas and spacing as seen in the examples:
-- the line starts with "Hero" then the player name, then their HP followed by "HP",
-- then "wielding " followed by either the weapon name or "(nothing)", then "wearing", followed
-- by the helm, armour, and boots names or "(no helm)", "(no armour)", "(no boots)".  The boots
-- are the last element of the list so should have "and" before and a full stop after.
-- See these two examples for the expected formatting, spacing, and punctuation:
-- (Player "Ray" (12,63) 94 [(Item "T-Shirt of Defiance" Armour 12), (Item "dagger" Weapon 8), (Item "leather boots" Boots 4), (Item "mining cap" Helm 6)])
--    should return
-- "Hero Ray, 94 HP, wielding dagger, wearing mining cap, T-Shirt of Defiance, and leather boots."

-- Q 15) Not an actual question, this "question" is worth 5 marks and will be based
-- on the use of good Haskell coding style in your solutions.  This includes things like
-- appropriately sized functions; re-use of existing functions and types instead of reimplementing them;
-- idiomatic use of functional programming techniques like recusion, higher-order functions,
-- and pattern matching; identifier naming; and code layout.
